Trello requirements

1. User Management
	a. Sign-up: Register/Sign-up a user through their email address and a password. Follow basic password validation by having a minimum length of 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character, 1 number and 1 special character.
	b. Login: A user must be able to login through their registered email address and password.
	c. Forgot password: Reset the userâ€™s password in your database through this functionality.
	
2. Create a workspace and boards
Workspace: A workspace is something that can hold multiple boards. For e.g., CSCI 3130 Workspace can have a board for planning the syllabus, classes and tutorials, or a board for each project group.
Board: A board contains tasks which will be displayed in the form of cards. Each task would have a status as To-Do, Doing or Done. For e.g., your group project has several features and each one has some tasks. You can create a card for each task and assign it a status. This way you will be able to track how many tasks you have completed or are yet to complete.
The following features are expected w.r.t. workspace and board.
	a. Create a workspace
	b. Add members to your workspace
	c. Update workspace details
	d. Create a board inside the workspace
	e. Delete a board
	
3. Task management
	a. Create tasks in the form of cards. Note that tasks are a part of boards and workspaces contain one or more boards
	b. Assign a task to a particular member belonging to the workspace
	c. Change the status of the task. For e.g., move it from To-Do to Doing
	d. Create a date field and set a date of completion
	
4. Search and filter
	a. Search for task cards based on task names

2. Notification and alerts: Send emails on the tasks that are in progress and must be done by the next day
